Directory Structure:
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplemobiletools/calculator/`:
  - `activities/MainActivity.kt`: This is the main entry point of the app, handling the user interface and interaction.
  - `helpers/CalculatorImpl.kt`: Contains the core logic for mathematical operations.
  - `models/`: May include data models for the app, though this folder is not always present depending on the version.
  
- `res/`: Contains resources like layouts (`layout/`), strings (`values/strings.xml`), and drawables (`drawable/`).

 Key Files and Functions:

1. `MainActivity.kt`:
   - `onCreate()`: Initializes the activity, sets up the UI components, and loads any saved state.
   - `initButtons()`: Connects the UI buttons to their respective functions, e.g., digit buttons, operation buttons.
   - `onDigitClicked()`: Appends the digit clicked by the user to the current input string.
   - `onOperationClicked()`: Manages operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - `onEqualsClicked()`: Calls `calculateResult()` to evaluate the current expression and display the result.

2. `CalculatorImpl.kt`:
   - `add()`: Adds two numbers.
   - `subtract()`: Subtracts the second number from the first.
   - `multiply()`: Multiplies two numbers.
   - `divide()`: Divides the first number by the second.
   - `calculateResult()`: Evaluates the current expression and handles any errors (like division by zero).

3. `res/layout/activity_main.xml`:
   - Defines the UI layout, including buttons for digits, operations, and the display area for the calculation and result.
 Major Parts of the Code:
1. UI Management (`MainActivity.kt`):
   - The main activity manages all interactions, from button presses to updating the display. It uses Kotlin’s concise syntax to handle events and update the UI dynamically.
2. Core Calculation Logic (`CalculatorImpl.kt`):
   - The helper class `CalculatorImpl.kt` abstracts the mathematical operations, making the core logic modular and easier to maintain. It directly interacts with `MainActivity` to perform the necessary calculations when the user requests them.
3. Error Handling:
   - The app gracefully handles errors like division by zero or invalid input, ensuring the user has a smooth experience.
4. User Interface (`activity_main.xml`):
   - The layout is simple and intuitive, with buttons arranged for easy access. It’s designed to be responsive and work well across different screen sizes.
 Conclusion:
The Simple Calculator project is structured to separate concerns between UI management and core logic, making it both modular and easy to extend. Understanding how `MainActivity.kt` handles user interactions and how `CalculatorImpl.kt` processes calculations is key to mastering the app’s functionality.
