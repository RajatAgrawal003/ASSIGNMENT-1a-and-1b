. ### Code Structure and Functionality
1. `main() Function`:
   - Manages the program's workflow. It begins by asking the user for the number of vertices and edges in the graph. It then reads the graph's adjacency matrix, which represents the weights of the edges between vertices. Once the graph is set up, the `dijkstra()` function is called to compute the shortest paths from a specified source vertex to all other vertices.
2. `dijkstra(int graph[MAX][MAX], int n, int start)` Function:
   - Implements Dijkstra's algorithm. It starts by initializing an array `distance` to hold the shortest distance from the source to each vertex, and another array `visited` to track which vertices have been processed. The function then iteratively selects the unvisited vertex with the smallest known distance from the source. For each neighbor of this vertex, the function checks if a shorter path can be found and updates the `distance` array accordingly. This process repeats until all vertices have been visited.
3. Input Handling:
   - The user is prompted to enter the number of vertices and edges, followed by the details of each edge in the form of an adjacency matrix. This makes the program flexible to handle various graph structures.
4. Output:
   - After computing the shortest paths, the program outputs the minimum distance from the source vertex to each vertex in the graph.
### Key Features

- Graph Representation: Uses an adjacency matrix to represent the graph, where `graph[i][j]` holds the weight of the edge from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.
- Shortest Path Calculation: Employs Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.
- User Interaction: The program is designed to interact with the user, taking inputs dynamically and providing outputs based on the given graph structure.
This project effectively demonstrates how Dijkstra's algorithm can be implemented in C to solve the single-source shortest path problem in weighted graphs. The code is organized to be easily understood and modified for various use cases.
